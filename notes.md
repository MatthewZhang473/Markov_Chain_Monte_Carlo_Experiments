Gaussian random walk Metropolic Hasting & PcN are simply two method of MH algorithm

- each use a different proposal measure
- each has a different expression of the acceptatnce probability - with the PcN being invariant to dimensionality increase (mesh refinement) - as it is defined on infinite dimensional hilbert space
